1. Create a variable marks and assign any number. If marks are greater than 60 then print Pass else print Fail.
2. Take two numbers and check if both numbers are odd or not. If yes then print Odd otherwise print Even
3. Take 4 variables a, b, c, d and assign their values in the way mentioned below and check output:
   a = b
   b = c
   c = d
   d = a
4. Print 2's table using \*\* operator. Use any logic but it should print 2's table.
5. Check output of following and validate your answers
   ```
   2+5*10-20\*\*2
   20/5*10+10
   10 && 20 + 10 \* 10
   30 > 20 && 10 + 4 < 15
   30 > 20 && 10 + 4 < 15 || 10
   30 < 20 || 10 + 5 < 15 || 10
   30 < 20 || 10 + 5 < 15 && 10
   ```
6. Take a number and check if number is odd or not. If number is Odd then print Yes else print No
7. Take a number and check if number is divisible by 10 && 5. If yes then print Yes else print no
8. Take a number and check if number \* 20 makes it 100 or not. If yes the print Yes else print No
9. Calculate your 10th percentage and print Pass or Fail if marks are more than 70 then print Pass else print Fail
10. Take your age and check if your age is greater than 21 then print Adult else print Minor
11. Convert all if-else solutions to ternary operator solution. So instead of using if-else, use ternary operator.
12. Implement mark-sheet logic

```
Take a field percentage
If percentage is >= 80 then print Distinction
If percentage is >= 60 and < 80 then print First division
If percentage >= 33 and < 60 then print Second division
if percentage < 33 then print Fail
```

13. Find maximum of 2 numbers
14. Find maximum of 3 numbers
