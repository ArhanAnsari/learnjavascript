### what is Polyfilling in javascript
Polyfilling in JavaScript refers to the practice of adding a code snippet that provides functionality that is not natively supported by older browsers. The polyfill code detects if a certain feature is missing and then adds it programmatically, allowing web developers to write code using modern JavaScript features while ensuring backwards compatibility with older browsers.
