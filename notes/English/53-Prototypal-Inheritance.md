### what is Prototypal inheritance and prototype chain in JavaScript
Prototypal inheritance is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects, known as their prototypes. When a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript first looks for it directly on the object, and if it's not found, it looks for it on the object's prototype, and then on the prototype's prototype, and so on, following the prototype chain until the property or method is found or until the end of the chain is reached (which is the object `Object.prototype`, the final fallback).

The prototype chain is the chain of prototypes that an object follows to access properties and methods. Each object has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]` (also accessible via the `__proto__` property) that points to its prototype object. When an object is created using object literals, the default prototype is `Object.prototype`. However, you can create custom prototypes by defining constructor functions and setting their `prototype` property to an object that will be used as the prototype for the objects created with that constructor function.


### what is Prototypal inheritance on Built-in objects in JavaScript
Prototypal inheritance is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. In the case of built-in objects, such as arrays or strings, they inherit their properties and methods from their prototype object. This means that any instance of an array, for example, will have access to all the properties and methods defined on the Array.prototype object. Similarly, instances of strings will have access to the properties and methods defined on the String.prototype object. This feature makes JavaScript highly flexible and extensible.
