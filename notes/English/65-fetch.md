### what is Promise and Fetch API in javascript
In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that represents a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved in the future, either successfully or unsuccessfully. It allows you to write asynchronous code that can be easily managed and avoids callback hell.

The Fetch API is a modern way to make HTTP requests in JavaScript. It provides a simpler and more flexible interface compared to the traditional XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object. The Fetch API returns Promises, which makes it easy to handle responses asynchronously. It also supports streaming responses and can handle cross-origin requests.
