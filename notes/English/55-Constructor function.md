### what is Constructor functions and new operator in JavaScript
Constructor functions in JavaScript are functions that are used to create and initialize objects. They are typically defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from regular functions. When a constructor function is called with the "new" operator, it creates a new object and sets the object's prototype to the constructor function's prototype property. The constructor function then initializes the newly created object with instance properties and methods.

The "new" operator in JavaScript is used to create a new instance of an object. When used with a constructor function, it creates a new object and invokes the constructor function to initialize the object. It returns the newly created object, which can be assigned to a variable or used directly. If the constructor function does not return anything explicitly, the "new" operator automatically returns the newly created object.
