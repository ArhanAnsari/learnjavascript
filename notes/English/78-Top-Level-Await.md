### explain Top-Level await (ES2022) in javascript
Top-level await is a new feature in JavaScript that allows you to use the `await` keyword outside of an asynchronous function at the top level of your code. This means that you can directly use `await` when importing modules or loading data from external APIs without having to wrap them inside an immediately invoked async function expression (IIFE) or inside an async function.

Before top-level await, you had to use workarounds like IIFEs or async functions to await module imports or API requests, which made the code more verbose and harder to read. With top-level await, you can simplify your code and make it more elegant.

However, top-level await is only available in modules or scripts with the `"module"` type. If you're using CommonJS modules (`require()`), you still need to use IIFEs or async functions to await module imports.


### what is The Module Pattern in javascript
The Module Pattern is a design pattern in JavaScript that allows for encapsulation of functionality into self-contained, reusable modules. It involves creating a closure around a set of private variables and methods, and exposing a public API through an interface (usually an object) to interact with those private members. This helps to prevent naming collisions and promotes better code organization and maintainability.
