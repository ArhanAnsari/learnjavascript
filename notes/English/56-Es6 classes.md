### what is ES6 classes in JavaScript
ES6 classes in JavaScript are a syntactic sugar that provides a cleaner and more concise way of defining constructor functions and creating objects with prototype-based inheritance. They use the "class" keyword to define a constructor function, which can have a constructor method, instance methods, and static methods. ES6 classes also support inheritance through the use of the "extends" keyword, allowing for easier code reuse and organization.

### what is Setters and Getters in JavaScript
Setters and getters are functions in JavaScript that allow you to define object properties with special behavior. A setter function is used to set the value of a property, while a getter function is used to retrieve the value of a property. They can be useful for enforcing data validation, accessing private variables, or triggering side effects when a property is accessed or modified. In ES6 and later versions of JavaScript, setters and getters can be defined using the `set` and `get` keywords respectively.
