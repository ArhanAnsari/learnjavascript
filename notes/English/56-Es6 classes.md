### what is ES6 classes in JavaScript
ES6 classes in JavaScript are a syntactic sugar that provides a cleaner and more concise way of defining constructor functions and creating objects with prototype-based inheritance. They use the "class" keyword to define a constructor function, which can have a constructor method, instance methods, and static methods. ES6 classes also support inheritance through the use of the "extends" keyword, allowing for easier code reuse and organization.

### what is Setters and Getters in JavaScript
Setters and getters are functions in JavaScript that allow you to define object properties with special behavior. A setter function is used to set the value of a property, while a getter function is used to retrieve the value of a property. They can be useful for enforcing data validation, accessing private variables, or triggering side effects when a property is accessed or modified. In ES6 and later versions of JavaScript, setters and getters can be defined using the `set` and `get` keywords respectively.

### what is Static methods in JavaScript
In JavaScript, static methods are methods that are defined on a class and can be called on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class. These methods are typically used for utility functions or operations that don't depend on any specific instance of the class. To define a static method in JavaScript, you can use the `static` keyword before the method name. For example:

```
class MyClass {
  static myStaticMethod() {
    console.log('This is a static method.');
  }
}

MyClass.myStaticMethod(); // Outputs: "This is a static method."
```

Note that unlike instance methods, static methods cannot access instance-specific properties or methods using `this`. Instead, they operate solely on the class itself or any arguments passed into them.
