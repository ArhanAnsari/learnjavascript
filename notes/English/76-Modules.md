### Modules in JavaScript 
In JavaScript, modules are a way to organize code into separate files or units of functionality. They allow developers to write reusable code and improve the maintainability and scalability of their applications. There are two main types of modules in JavaScript: 

1. CommonJS modules: This is the module format used in Node.js. It uses the `require()` function to import modules and the `module.exports` object to export them.

2. ES6 modules: This is the module format introduced in ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6. It uses the `import` statement to import modules and the `export` keyword to export them. ES6 modules can be used both in Node.js and in modern web browsers that support them.

Both CommonJS and ES6 modules can be used to create reusable code libraries and to organize code within a single application.
